# Memory Garden Writer Skill

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-02  
**Author:** Manus  
**Purpose:** Write structured, semantically rich memory entries for efficient context management

---

## Overview

This skill encodes the pattern for writing memory entries that follow the **4-Tier Context Iceberg** and **Hierarchical Memory** principles from Dojo Genesis v0.0.19. Use this skill to create memory entries that are easy to search, retrieve, and compress.

**Philosophy:** Memory should be a garden, not a landfill. Cultivate what matters, compost what doesn't.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating daily memory notes after a session
- Writing compressed summaries of conversations
- Extracting "seeds" (reusable insights) from experiences
- Documenting decisions and their rationale
- Maintaining the memory hierarchy (Tier A → Tier B → Tier C)

---

## Memory Hierarchy (From v0.0.19)

### Tier A: Raw Daily Notes
- **Location:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Purpose:** Capture everything from today's session
- **Lifespan:** 1-3 days before compression
- **Format:** Timestamped entries with context

### Tier B: Curated Wisdom
- **Location:** `MEMORY.md` (root level)
- **Purpose:** Distilled insights, decisions, patterns
- **Lifespan:** Permanent, but evolves
- **Format:** Structured sections with triggers

### Tier C: Compressed Archive
- **Location:** `memory/archive/YYYY-MM.md`
- **Purpose:** Historical record, rarely accessed
- **Lifespan:** Permanent, read-only
- **Format:** Semantic summaries

## The "3-Month Rule" (From Cipher)

**Rule:** If it wouldn't matter in 3 months → compress or discard.

**Keep:**
- Decisions and their rationale
- Lessons learned and patterns discovered
- Seeds (reusable insights)
- Significant events and outcomes

**Compress:**
- Routine activities ("worked on X")
- Pleasantries and confirmations
- Detailed step-by-step logs (keep summary only)

**Discard:**
- Duplicate information
- Temporary notes that were resolved
- Irrelevant tangents

---

## Semantic Compression Guidelines

### What to Keep (Verbatim)

1. **Decisions:** The choice, rationale, and context
2. **Insights:** Novel patterns or principles
3. **Seeds:** Reusable knowledge with triggers
4. **Failures:** What didn't work and why
5. **Breakthroughs:** Moments of clarity or innovation

### What to Summarize

1. **Activities:** "Worked on X, Y, Z" → "Implemented feature X"
2. **Discussions:** Long back-and-forth → Key points and outcome
3. **Research:** Detailed findings → Summary and conclusion
4. **Iterations:** Multiple attempts → Final approach and why

### What to Discard

1. **Pleasantries:** "Great work!" "Thank you!" (unless significant)
2. **Confirmations:** "Got it" "Understood" "Proceeding"
3. **Redundant logs:** Repeated information
4. **Resolved questions:** Questions that were answered and no longer relevant

---

## Memory Maintenance Cycle

**Every 3-7 Days:**

1. **Review Tier A (Daily Notes):**
   - Identify seeds to extract
   - Identify decisions to document
   - Identify patterns to record

2. **Update Tier B (Curated Wisdom):**
   - Add new seeds, decisions, patterns
   - Update existing entries if needed
   - Remove deprecated information

3. **Compress to Tier C (Archive):**
   - Apply 3-month rule
   - Create semantic summary
   - Move to archive folder

4. **Prune:**
   - Delete raw daily notes older than 7 days (after compression)
   - Keep only what matters

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a memory entry, verify:

### Daily Notes (Tier A)
- [ ] Timestamped entries with context
- [ ] Clear "What, Why, Outcome" structure
- [ ] Insights and learnings captured
- [ ] Decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Seeds extracted with triggers
- [ ] Tags and metadata included

### Curated Memory (Tier B)
- [ ] Principles are clear and actionable
- [ ] Decisions include context and rationale
- [ ] Patterns have evidence (3+ instances)
- [ ] Seeds have clear triggers
- [ ] Compression history is updated
- [ ] Maintenance date is set

### Compressed Archive (Tier C)
- [ ] Summary captures key events
- [ ] Decisions and lessons are preserved
- [ ] Seeds are extracted
- [ ] Compression ratio is calculated
- [ ] Original files are deleted after compression

---

## Examples

**From Dojo Genesis:**
- Daily notes from v0.0.17-v0.0.23 development
- Curated wisdom from Cipher collaboration
- Compressed archives from backend migration

**Study these for:**
- How to extract seeds from experiences
- How to document decisions with context
- How to apply the 3-month rule
- How to maintain the memory hierarchy

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Hoarding Everything:** Keeping every detail → ✅ Compress ruthlessly  
❌ **Vague Insights:** "This was useful" → ✅ "This pattern applies when X"  
❌ **Missing Triggers:** Seed without context → ✅ Seed with clear "when to apply"  
❌ **No Maintenance:** Let Tier A grow forever → ✅ Compress every 3-7 days  
❌ **Duplicate Information:** Same thing in multiple places → ✅ Single source of truth

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Read this skill** before writing memory entries
2. **Choose the right template** (Tier A, B, or C)
3. **Fill in each section** with specific, structured content
4. **Apply the 3-month rule** when compressing
5. **Maintain the cycle** every 3-7 days
6. **Run the quality checklist** before finalizing

---

## Skill Metadata

**Token Savings:** ~5,000-8,000 tokens per session (structured format enables efficient retrieval)  
**Quality Impact:** Ensures consistent memory format across sessions  
**Maintenance:** Update when new memory patterns emerge

## OpenClaw Tool Integration

When running inside the Dojo Genesis plugin:

1. **Start** by calling `dojo_get_context` to retrieve full project state, history, and artifacts
2. **During** the skill, follow the workflow steps documented above
3. **Save** outputs using `dojo_save_artifact` with the `artifacts` output directory
4. **Update** project state by calling `dojo_update_state` to record skill completion and any phase transitions
