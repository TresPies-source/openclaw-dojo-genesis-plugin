name: iterative-scouting
description: Iterate through scouting cycles by gathering feedback, identifying reframes, and re-scouting with new lenses. Use when initial scouting raises deeper questions. Trigger phrases: 'scout this, gather feedback, then re-scout', 'what is the reframe hiding in this feedback', 'iterate the scout', 'two-scout rule'

> **OpenClaw Integration:** This skill is invoked by the Dojo Genesis plugin via `/dojo run iterative-scouting`.

> Use `dojo_get_context` for full state, `dojo_save_artifact` to persist outputs,

# Iterative Scouting Pattern Skill

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-02-07
**Author:** Manus AI
**Purpose:** To formalize the meta-process of strategic scouting, emphasizing its iterative nature and the importance of reframing.

## I. The Philosophy: Scouting as a Conversation

Strategic scouting is not a linear process of finding the "right" answer. It is a **conversation** with the strategic landscape. The goal of the first scout is not to produce a final decision, but to generate a set of provocative routes that will elicit a deeper, more insightful response. The real prize is not the initial answer, but the **reframe** of the original question.

This skill operationalizes the pattern of **scout → feedback → reframe → re-scout**, turning a simple exploration into a powerful engine for strategic discovery.

## II. When to Use This Skill

-   When facing a complex strategic decision with no obvious answer.
-   When the initial framing of a problem feels too narrow or binary.
-   After an initial strategic scout has been completed and feedback has been gathered.
-   When you need to teach or demonstrate the process of strategic thinking.

## III. The Workflow

This is a 4-step workflow for the iterative scouting pattern.

### Step 1: Initial Scout

**Goal:** To explore the initial strategic tension and propose a set of viable routes.

**Actions:**
-   Identify the initial tension (e.g., "Deprecate vs. Companion").
-   Use `/strategic-scout` to explore a diverse set of routes.
-   Synthesize the routes and propose a provocative starting point.

### Step 2: Gather Feedback & Listen for the Reframe

**Goal:** To present the initial scouting results and listen for the deeper question hidden in the feedback.

**Actions:**
-   Present the initial routes.
-   Listen not just for agreement or disagreement, but for the *way* the feedback is framed.
-   Identify the "question behind the question" (e.g., the shift from "what to do with the web app" to "what is the mobile experience for?").

### Step 3: Re-Scout with the New Lens

**Goal:** To conduct a second round of scouting using the new, more powerful framing.

**Actions:**
-   Articulate the new, reframed tension (e.g., "Deep Work vs. On-the-Go").
-   Use `/strategic-scout` again with this new lens.
-   Explore routes that are native to the new framing.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Align on the Final Vision

**Goal:** To synthesize the results of the second scouting round into a final, coherent product vision.

**Actions:**
-   Select the best route from the second round.
-   Define the final product positioning, timeline, and business model.
-   Confirm alignment and commit to the vision.

## IV. Best Practices

-   **The Two-Scout Rule:** For any non-trivial strategic decision, assume you will need at least two rounds of scouting.
-   **The Reframe is the Prize:** The most valuable output of the process is the new, more powerful question you discover.
-   **Scout for Provocation, Not for Consensus:** The goal of the first scout is to provoke a better conversation, not to find an answer that everyone agrees with.

---

## V. Quality Checklist

Before concluding the process, ensure you can answer "yes" to all of the following questions:

-   [ ] Have you completed at least two rounds of scouting?
-   [ ] Can you clearly articulate the initial tension and the reframed tension?
-   [ ] Did the reframe lead to a richer, more insightful set of strategic options?
-   [ ] Is the final vision aligned with the insights from the second scouting round?
-   [ ] Is the final decision documented and socialized?

## OpenClaw Tool Integration

When running inside the Dojo Genesis plugin:

1. **Start** by calling `dojo_get_context` to retrieve full project state, history, and artifacts
2. **During** the skill, follow the workflow steps documented above
3. **Save** outputs using `dojo_save_artifact` with the `artifacts` output directory
4. **Update** project state by calling `dojo_update_state` to record skill completion and any phase transitions
