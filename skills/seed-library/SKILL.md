# Seed Module Library

Manage and apply the **10 Dojo Seed Patches** plus **3 field seeds** as reusable thinking modules. The core seeds derive from Dataiku research; the field seeds emerged from direct practice. Make enterprise-grade agent patterns accessible, consistent, and evolvable.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- User asks "What seed applies here?" or "Which pattern should I use?"
- Keywords match seed triggers (governance, multi-agent, cost, context, routing, etc.)
- Architecting new features or systems
- Debugging complex issues
- Optimizing costs or performance
- Building trust through transparency

## The 10 Core Seeds

1. **Three-Tiered Governance** - Strategic/Tactical/Operational framework
2. **Harness Trace** - Nested spans + events for traceability
3. **Context Iceberg** - 6x token multiplier, hierarchical loading
4. **Agent Connect** - Routing-first, not swarm-first
5. **Go-Live Bundles** - Reusable artifacts (DojoPacket)
6. **Cost Guard** - Budget for full iceberg (5-10x multiplier)
7. **Safety Switch** - Fallback to conservative mode
8. **Implicit Perspective Extraction** - Extract from constraints/metaphors
9. **Mode-Based Complexity Gating** - 3-question test
10. **Shared Infrastructure** - Build once, reuse everywhere

**Meta-Seed:** Governance Multiplies Velocity

### Field Seeds (From Practice)
11. **Voice Before Structure** - Read design language before writing structural artifacts
12. **Pointer Directories** - Empty directories are references, not gaps
13. **Granular Visibility** - Progress tracking serves the user, not the agent

## Core Workflow

### 1. Suggest Relevant Seeds

Based on keywords or task context:

```bash
python3.11 /home/ubuntu/skills/seed-library/scripts/suggest_seeds.py <keywords...>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3.11 suggest_seeds.py multi-agent architecture coordination
```

**Output:**
- Top 3 relevant seeds ranked by relevance score
- Brief description of each seed
- File path to full seed content

**Saved to:** `/home/ubuntu/seed-suggestions.md`

### 2. Apply a Seed

Load full seed content and application guide:

```bash
python3.11 /home/ubuntu/skills/seed-library/scripts/apply_seed.py <seed_id> [session_id]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3.11 apply_seed.py 04_agent_connect session_123
```

**Output:**
- Full seed content (What It Is, Why It Matters, The Pattern, etc.)
- Application checklist
- Next steps
- Usage tracked automatically

**Saved to:** `/home/ubuntu/seed-<seed_id>-applied.md`

## Script Reference

### suggest_seeds.py

## Reference Documents

### seed_catalog.md

Quick reference to all 10 seeds plus meta-seed:
- One-line descriptions
- Triggers and refusals
- Seed relationships
- Usage patterns (5 common scenarios)
- Maintenance guidelines

**Read this when:**
- Getting overview of all seeds
- Understanding seed relationships
- Learning usage patterns

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Architecting Multi-Agent System

**User says:** "How should we architect the multi-agent system?"

**Workflow:**
1. Run `suggest_seeds.py multi-agent architecture coordination`
2. Top suggestions: Agent Connect, Shared Infrastructure, Three-Tiered Governance
3. Apply Seed 04 (Agent Connect)
4. Follow application checklist
5. Track usage

**Output:**
> Based on your query, I recommend **Agent Connect** (Seed 04). This seed provides a routing-first pattern where the Supervisor acts as a single entry point, routing to specialized agents (Dojo, Librarian, Debugger, Builder) based on context. This prevents agent sprawl and keeps coordination manageable.

### Use Case 2: Optimizing Token Usage

**User says:** "Token usage is spiking, how do we optimize?"

**Workflow:**
1. Run `suggest_seeds.py token cost context optimization`
2. Top suggestions: Context Iceberg, Cost Guard, Mode-Based Complexity Gating
3. Apply Seed 03 (Context Iceberg)
4. Implement hierarchical context loading (Tier 1-4)
5. Set pruning triggers (80%, 90%, 95%)

**Output:**
> The **Context Iceberg** pattern (Seed 03) explains the 6x token multiplier from demo to production. Implement hierarchical context loading with 4 tiers, and set pruning triggers at 80% (prune Tier 4), 90% (prune Tier 3), and 95% (alert user).

### Use Case 3: Debugging Unexpected Behavior

**User says:** "Why did Dojo choose Scout instead of Mirror?"

**Workflow:**
1. Run `suggest_seeds.py debugging trace transparency`
2. Top suggestion: Harness Trace
3. Apply Seed 02 (Harness Trace)
4. Review trace spans for `mode_selection`
5. Read `metadata.reasoning`

**Output:**
> Use the **Harness Trace** (Seed 02) to inspect the decision path. Check the `mode_selection` span in the trace JSON. The `metadata.reasoning` field will explain why Scout was chosen over Mirror.

### Use Case 4: Building Trust with Users

**User says:** "Users don't understand our recommendations"

**Workflow:**
1. Run `suggest_seeds.py trust transparency trace`
2. Top suggestions: Harness Trace, Go-Live Bundles, Governance Multiplies Velocity
3. Apply Seed 02 (Harness Trace) for transparency
4. Apply Seed 05 (Go-Live Bundles) for repeatability
5. Apply Meta-Seed for philosophy

**Output:**
> Build trust through **Harness Trace** (transparency), **Go-Live Bundles** (repeatability), and the **Governance Multiplies Velocity** philosophy. Show users the decision path, make sessions exportable and inspectable, and emphasize that governance accelerates delivery.

### Use Case 5: Planning New Feature

**User says:** "Let's plan the Workbench feature"

**Workflow:**
1. Run `suggest_seeds.py planning feature governance`
2. Top suggestions: Three-Tiered Governance, Cost Guard, Shared Infrastructure
3. Apply Seed 01 (Three-Tiered Governance)
4. Define strategic (principles), tactical (standards), operational (tools)
5. Apply Seed 06 (Cost Guard) to budget for 5-10x multiplier

**Output:**
> Start with **Three-Tiered Governance** (Seed 01). Define strategic principles (does this align with "no autopilot"?), tactical standards (DojoPacket schema, routing logic), and operational tools (tests, traces). Then apply **Cost Guard** (Seed 06) to budget for the full iceberg, not just API costs.

## Integration with Dojo Agent

When Dojo is reasoning, it can reference seeds:

**Example:**
> "Considering **Agent Connect** (Seed 04) for this multi-agent architecture. Using Supervisor as router with transparent handoffs."

**Example:**
> "Applying **Context Iceberg** (Seed 03) to manage token usage. Loading Tier 1 + Tier 2 context for this query."

## Seed Maintenance

### When to Update a Seed
- Pattern evolves based on new learnings
- Better approach discovered
- User feedback suggests improvement

### When to Archive a Seed
- Pattern no longer applies
- Superseded by better approach
- Context has fundamentally changed

### Versioning Convention
- **1.0** - Initial version from Dataiku research
- **1.1** - Minor update (clarification, example added)
- **2.0** - Major update (pattern changed)

### Update Process
1. Identify need for update
2. Draft new version
3. Test with real scenarios
4. Update seed file with "Revised:" section
5. Update seed_catalog.md
6. Notify users of change

## Best Practices

### Frequency
- **Proactive:** Suggest seeds during planning and design
- **Reactive:** Apply seeds when debugging or optimizing
- **Continuous:** Track usage to identify most valuable seeds

### Application
- **Read the full seed** before applying (don't just skim)
- **Follow the checklist** to validate application
- **Note what it refuses** to avoid anti-patterns
- **Track usage** to measure effectiveness

### Evolution
- **Update when patterns evolve** (not just for the sake of updating)
- **Archive when obsolete** (don't hoard outdated seeds)
- **Version carefully** (breaking changes = major version bump)

## Limitations

### What This Skill Does
- Suggest relevant seeds based on keywords
- Load and explain how to apply seeds
- Track usage over time
- Provide quick reference to all seeds

### What This Skill Doesn't Do
- Automatically apply seeds (you still need to implement)
- Make architectural decisions for you
- Guarantee success (seeds are patterns, not silver bullets)
- Replace deep thinking (seeds guide, they don't replace reasoning)

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Suggest seeds | `python3.11 suggest_seeds.py <keywords...>` |
| Apply seed | `python3.11 apply_seed.py <seed_id>` |
| View catalog | `file read references/seed_catalog.md` |
| Check usage | `cat /home/ubuntu/.seed-usage.json` |
| List all seeds | `ls /home/ubuntu/skills/seed-library/seeds/` |

## Success Metrics

- **Accessibility:** Find relevant seed in < 10 seconds
- **Consistency:** Seeds applied correctly 90%+ of the time
- **Evolution:** Seeds updated when patterns improve
- **Reuse:** Seeds used across multiple sessions
- **Learning:** New seeds added as patterns emerge
