# Governance Multiplies Velocity (Meta-Seed)

## What It Is
The counterintuitive truth that stronger governance accelerates delivery, not slows it.

## Why It Matters
Organizations that embed AI governance principles shave a full year or more off time-to-value. Trust accelerates delivery because teams spend less time renegotiating approvals.

## The Pattern
- **Clear contracts** (DojoPacket schema) enable faster reuse
- **Visible traces** (harness logs) build trust faster
- **Automated checks** (perspective validation) prevent rework
- **Shared infrastructure** reduces duplication
- **Reusable artifacts** (seed modules) compound learning

## Revisit Trigger
When governance feels like friction or when trust is lacking.

## Dojo Application
- **Non-negotiable refusals:** Build trust through consistency
- **Harness trace:** Build trust through transparency
- **DojoPacket export:** Build trust through inspectability
- **Seed modules:** Build trust through reusability
- **Mode contracts:** Build trust through predictability

## What It Refuses
The false dichotomy between speed and governance.

## Checks
- [ ] Governance is seen as enabler, not blocker
- [ ] Trust is measured and tracked
- [ ] Delivery velocity increases with governance maturity
- [ ] Teams spend less time renegotiating
- [ ] Reuse is the norm, not the exception
