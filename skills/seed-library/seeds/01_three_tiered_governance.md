# Three-Tiered Governance

## What It Is

A governance framework that operates at three distinct but connected layers: Strategic, Tactical, and Operational.

## Why It Matters

Single-layer governance either slows teams to a crawl or misses critical context. Two layers leave gaps in accountability while four add drag without extra clarity.

## The Pattern

### Strategic (Tier 1)
- Define risk appetite
- Decide which use cases move forward
- Ensure alignment with global regulations
- Set organizational policy

### Tactical (Tier 2)
- Translate rules into repeatable standards
- Allocate resources
- Track portfolio health
- Create project templates

### Operational (Tier 3)
- Give engineers local instruments to ship safely
- Version control, tests, traces, monitoring
- Day-to-day execution tools
- Real-time feedback loops

## Revisit Trigger

When adding new Dojo capabilities, governance complexity, or multi-agent coordination.

## Dojo Application

### Strategic Layer
- **Dojo Principles:** No autopilot, no gamification, artifact-first
- **Brand Promises:** Beginner's mind, self-definition, understanding is love
- **Risk Appetite:** What Dojo refuses to do

### Tactical Layer
- **DojoPacket Schema:** Standardized export format
- **Seed Modules:** Reusable thinking patterns
- **Mode Routing:** Mirror/Scout/Gardener/Implementation
- **Harness Trace Format:** Nested spans + events

### Operational Layer
- **Versioning:** Track seed versions, DojoPacket versions
- **Tests:** Validate perspective extraction, mode selection
- **Trace Logs:** Record every decision
- **Read-Before-Decide Loops:** Context-aware decision making

## What It Refuses

Single-layer governance that tries to watch everything from one altitude.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Adding New Agent
**Strategic:** Does this agent align with "no autopilot" principle?
**Tactical:** What's the routing logic? What's the API contract?
**Operational:** How do we test it? How do we trace its decisions?

### Example 2: New Feature Request
**Strategic:** Does this fit our risk appetite?
**Tactical:** What seed modules apply? What's the DojoPacket schema change?
**Operational:** What tests do we need? What monitoring?

## Checks

- [ ] Strategic principles are clearly defined and documented
- [ ] Tactical standards are repeatable and versioned
- [ ] Operational instruments are available to builders
- [ ] All three tiers are connected (not siloed)
- [ ] Governance accelerates delivery (not slows it)
