- ⏸️ **Paused:** Intentionally on hold.
- ⚠️ **Concern:** Needs attention but not blocking.
- ❌ **Blocked/Critical:** Halted or failing.

## 3. Directory Structure & Folder Status

<!-- Annotated tree. Every line gets a status emoji and a short note.
     Use 📦 for legacy/deprecated. Use — for empty/minimal. -->

```
project-root/                          [emoji] [note]
├── [dir1]/                            [emoji] [note]
│   ├── [subdir1]/                     [emoji] [note]
│   └── [subdir2]/                     [emoji] [note]
├── [dir2]/                            [emoji] [note]
└── [file1]                            [emoji] [note]
```

## 4. Semantic Action-Verb Clusters

<!-- One subsection per cluster. Include only clusters that apply. -->

### [emoji] [VERB] — [Short Description]

> [One sentence explaining what this capability means for the system.]

| Component | Location | Status | LOC |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| [Name] | [path/to/component/] | [emoji] | [number] |
<!-- Add all components that belong to this cluster -->

**Health:** [emoji] [1-line assessment]
**Audit Notes:** [Key technical details, constraints, risks. 1-2 lines max.]

---

<!-- Repeat for each cluster -->

### Cross-Cluster Components

<!-- Components that serve multiple clusters -->

| Component | Directory | Primary Cluster | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| [Name] | [path/] | [VERB] | [Why it's cross-cluster] |

### Backend-Only Integrations (No Frontend UI)

<!-- Services with no corresponding UI components. Explain why. -->

[List and explain.]

## 5. File Importance Ranking

### Tier 1 — Critical (System won't function without these)

| Rank | File | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 1 | [path/to/file] | [One-line justification] |
<!-- 10 files typical -->

### Tier 2 — Important (Core features break without these)

| Rank | File | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 11 | [path/to/file] | [One-line justification] |
<!-- 10 files typical -->

### Tier 3 — Supporting (Degrade gracefully without these)

| Rank | File | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 21-25 | [path/to/files] | [Category description] |
<!-- Group by category, 20-30 files typical -->

### Tier 4 — Knowledge (Essential for development, not runtime)

| Rank | File | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 51 | [path/to/file] | [One-line justification] |
<!-- Variable count -->

---

## 6. Health Assessment

<!-- Per the health-audit framework -->

### Critical Issues
<!-- Build failures, critical vulnerabilities, broken main branch -->
- **[None / List issues]**

### Security

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Secret management | [emoji] | [Assessment] |
| Authentication | [emoji] | [Assessment] |
| Authorization/RLS | [emoji] | [Assessment] |
| Encryption | [emoji] | [Assessment] |

### Sustainability

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Backend test coverage | [emoji] | [Percentage + assessment] |
| Frontend test coverage | [emoji] | [Percentage + assessment] |
| CI/CD automation | [emoji] | [Workflow count + assessment] |
| Technical debt | [emoji] | [Assessment] |
| Documentation | [emoji] | [File count + assessment] |
| Manual processes | [emoji] | [List any] |

## 7. Active Workstreams

<!-- What's being worked on right now -->

| Workstream | Owner/Agent | Status | Focus |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| [Name] | [Who] | [emoji] | [What they're doing] |

---

## 8. Blockers & Dependencies

<!-- Be ruthlessly honest. If nothing, say "None." -->

- **[Blocker description]** — [Impact and who owns resolution]

---

## 9. Next Steps

1. [emoji] [Concrete, actionable task]
2. [emoji] [Concrete, actionable task]
3. [emoji] [Concrete, actionable task]

## Template Usage Notes

1. **Delete all HTML comments** (`<!-- -->`) before saving the final document.
2. **Adapt the section count.** Small projects may combine sections 7-9 or skip section 5.
3. **Emoji consistency matters.** Use the status key from section 2 everywhere.
4. **LOC is approximate.** Use `~` prefix for estimates. Exact to within 10% is fine.
5. **The tree in section 3 should be complete but not exhaustive.** Show 2-3 levels deep for most directories. Go deeper only for architecturally significant subtrees.
6. **Section 4 (clusters) is the most variable.** A simple app might have 4-5 clusters. A complex platform might have 13+. Let the project's actual capabilities determine the count.
