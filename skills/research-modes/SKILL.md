# Research Modes Skill

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-02  
**Author:** Manus  
**Purpose:** Structured approaches for deep and wide research tasks

---

## Overview

This skill encodes two complementary research modes: **Deep Research** (focused, comprehensive investigation of a specific topic) and **Wide Research** (broad scan across multiple topics to identify patterns and opportunities). Use this skill to conduct efficient, high-quality research that produces actionable insights.

**Philosophy:** Research is not about collecting information—it's about building understanding and making decisions.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a new feature or system architecture
- Investigating a technical problem or design challenge
- Exploring competitive landscape or market trends
- Synthesizing learnings from multiple sources
- Making informed decisions based on evidence

---

## Research Mode Selection

### Deep Research Mode

**Use when:**
- You need comprehensive understanding of a specific topic
- The decision depends on technical details
- You're evaluating a complex system or architecture
- You need to become an "expert" in a narrow domain

**Characteristics:**
- Focused scope (1-3 related topics)
- Multiple sources per topic (5-10+)
- Deep analysis and synthesis
- Produces detailed report or specification

**Timeline:** 2-8 hours

### Wide Research Mode

**Use when:**
- You're exploring a new problem space
- You need to identify patterns across multiple domains
- You're scouting for inspiration or best practices
- You want to understand the landscape before diving deep

**Characteristics:**
- Broad scope (10-50+ topics)
- Few sources per topic (1-3)
- Pattern recognition and clustering
- Produces landscape map or opportunity matrix

**Timeline:** 1-4 hours

---

## Deep Research Mode

### Phase 1: Define Scope (15-30 minutes)

**Questions to answer:**
1. What is the core question I'm trying to answer?
2. What decision will this research inform?
3. What level of detail do I need?
4. What are the boundaries (in scope vs. out of scope)?
5. What success criteria will I use?

**Output:** Research brief (1-2 paragraphs)

**Template:**

```markdown
## Research Brief

**Question:** [The core question]

**Decision:** [What this research will inform]

**Scope:**
- In scope: [Topics, domains, or questions to explore]
- Out of scope: [Topics to explicitly exclude]

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

**Timeline:** [Expected duration]
```

### Phase 2: Source Discovery (30-60 minutes)

**Methods:**
- Search for academic papers, technical documentation, blog posts
- Identify authoritative sources (official docs, research labs, industry leaders)
- Look for case studies, implementations, and real-world examples
- Check GitHub repositories, open-source projects, and code examples

**Quality Filters:**
- Recency (prefer sources from last 2-3 years unless historical context is needed)
- Authority (prefer official docs, peer-reviewed papers, recognized experts)
- Relevance (directly addresses the research question)
- Depth (provides technical details, not just overviews)

**Output:** Source list (10-20 sources)

**Template:**

```markdown
## Sources

### Primary Sources (Authoritative)
1. [Title] - [Author/Organization] - [Year] - [URL]
   - **Why:** [Relevance to research question]
   - **Key Claims:** [What this source argues]

### Secondary Sources (Supporting)
[Repeat structure]

### Code Examples / Implementations
[Repeat structure]
```

### Phase 3: Deep Reading & Note-Taking (1-3 hours)

**Process:**
1. Read each source with the research question in mind
2. Extract key insights, claims, and evidence
3. Note disagreements or contradictions between sources
4. Identify patterns and themes
5. Flag open questions or gaps

**Note-Taking Structure:**

```markdown
## Notes: [Source Title]

**Main Argument:** [1-2 sentences]

**Key Insights:**
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

**Evidence:**
- [Data point, study, or example]

**Disagreements:**
- [How this contradicts other sources]

**Open Questions:**
- [What this source doesn't address]

**Quotes:**
> "[Exact quote]" (Page X)

**Relevance:** [How this informs the research question]
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Analysis (1-2 hours)

**Questions to answer:**
1. What are the major themes or patterns?
2. What do most sources agree on?
3. Where do sources disagree, and why?
4. What are the tradeoffs or tensions?
5. What gaps remain in the knowledge?

**Output:** Synthesis document

**Template:**

```markdown
## Research Synthesis: [Topic]

**Research Question:** [The core question]

---

### Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs summarizing the key findings and recommendations]

- [Source 2] supports this with [Y]
- [Source 3] provides example: [Z]

**Confidence:** High | Medium | Low

**Implication:** [What this means for the decision]

#### Finding 2: [Theme or Pattern]

[Repeat structure]

```

### Phase 5: Validation (30-60 minutes)

**Questions to ask:**
1. Did I answer the research question?
2. Are my recommendations actionable?
3. Did I consider counterarguments?
4. Are there gaps in my reasoning?
5. Would someone else reach the same conclusion?

**Validation Methods:**
- Review against success criteria
- Check for confirmation bias (did I only seek supporting evidence?)
- Test recommendations against edge cases
- Share with a peer for feedback (if available)

## Wide Research Mode

### Phase 1: Define Landscape (15-30 minutes)

**Questions to answer:**
1. What problem space am I exploring?
2. What are the boundaries of this landscape?
3. What am I looking for (patterns, tools, approaches)?
4. How will I know when I've covered enough ground?

**Output:** Landscape brief (1-2 paragraphs)

**Template:**

```markdown
## Landscape Brief

**Problem Space:** [The domain or challenge]

**Goal:** [What I'm trying to discover]

**Boundaries:**

3. Plot on a 2x2 matrix (e.g., effort vs. impact)
4. Prioritize based on goals

**Output:** Opportunity matrix

**Template:**

```markdown
## Opportunity Matrix

| Approach | Effort | Impact | Risk | Novelty | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| [Approach 1] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | 1-5 |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Scope Creep:** Starting focused, ending scattered → ✅ Define boundaries upfront  
❌ **Confirmation Bias:** Only seeking supporting evidence → ✅ Actively seek counterarguments  
❌ **Analysis Paralysis:** Reading forever, never synthesizing → ✅ Set time limits  
❌ **Surface Skimming:** Reading titles, not content → ✅ Take structured notes  
❌ **No Synthesis:** Collecting info, not building understanding → ✅ Answer the research question

---
