# Write Frontend Spec From Backend Skill

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-02-07
**Author:** Manus AI
**Purpose:** To provide a structured, repeatable process for writing high-quality frontend specifications that are deeply integrated with an existing backend, ensuring seamless development and reducing integration friction.

---

## I. The Philosophy: Grounding Before Building

Frontend development in a full-stack application does not happen in a vacuum. The most common source of bugs, delays, and rework is a disconnect between the frontend implementation and the backend reality. This skill is built on a simple but powerful principle: **grounding before building**.

By deeply understanding the existing backend architecture, APIs, and data models *before* writing a single line of frontend specification, we can prevent entire classes of integration problems. This process transforms specification writing from a creative exercise into a disciplined engineering practice, ensuring that what we design is not just beautiful, but buildable.

## II. When to Use This Skill

-   **When planning a new frontend feature** that will interact with an existing backend.
-   **When writing specifications for a UI redesign** of a feature that has a backend component.
-   **When commissioning frontend work to an autonomous agent** like Claude Code, Zenflow, or other implementation agents.
-   **When you feel a disconnect** between the frontend vision and the backend reality.
-   **At the beginning of any major frontend development cycle**.

## III. The Workflow

This workflow is a 5-step process that takes you from a high-level feature idea to a production-ready, backend-grounded specification.

### Step 1: Deep Backend Analysis

**Goal:** Achieve a comprehensive understanding of the existing backend architecture.

1.  **Run `/repo-context-sync`:** Generate a comprehensive context map of the repository.
2.  **Read Key Backend Files:**
    -   `main.go` (or equivalent): Understand route registration and server setup.
    -   `handlers/`: Read the handlers for the relevant feature areas.
    -   `middleware/`: Understand the authentication and request lifecycle.
3.  **Document APIs:** Map all relevant API endpoints, including methods, authentication requirements, request bodies, and success/error responses.
4.  **Identify Integration Points:** For each part of the new frontend feature, identify the specific backend endpoint it will interact with.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Feature Specification

**Goal:** Write a production-ready specification for the new feature that leverages the existing backend.

1.  **Write a Full Feature Spec:** Create a detailed document covering:
    -   Executive summary and problem statement
    -   Goals, non-goals, and user stories
    -   Technical architecture (how frontend and backend will interact)
    -   UI/UX wireframes and interaction flows
    -   API contracts with request/response examples
    -   Implementation plan (if multi-phased)
    -   Security considerations
2.  **Leverage Existing Backend:** Design the feature to use existing backend infrastructure wherever possible. Avoid proposing new backend features unless absolutely necessary.

### Step 3: Integration Guide Creation

**Goal:** Create a practical guide for developers on how to wire the new frontend to the backend.

1.  **Create a Track-by-Track Guide:** If the feature is being built in parallel tracks, create a guide for each track.
2.  **Document Authentication Flow:** Explain how the frontend should handle authentication (guest mode, API key mode, cloud sync).
3.  **Explain Streaming Architecture:** If the feature uses streaming, document the SSE or WebSocket connection and event handling.
4.  **Provide Code Examples:** Include frontend code snippets for making API calls.
5.  **Document Error Handling:** Specify how the frontend should handle different backend error codes.

### Step 4: Track Prompt Enhancement

**Goal:** Update all development prompts (e.g., for implementation agents like Zenflow or Claude Code) with backend grounding.

1.  **Add a "Backend Grounding" Section:** In each prompt, add a dedicated section that explains the backend context.
2.  **Document Specific Endpoints:** For each part of the implementation, specify the exact API endpoint to use.
3.  **Reference the Integration Guide:** Link to the full integration guide for more details.
4.  **Ensure Prompts Use Existing Patterns:** Explicitly instruct the development agent to follow existing backend patterns.

### Step 5: Audit and Deliver

**Goal:** Ensure all documentation is complete, consistent, and ready for commissioning.

1.  **Run a Final Audit:** Review all documents for gaps, inconsistencies, or missing information.
2.  **Write Missing Documentation:** If any gaps are found (e.g., design system, API contracts), write the missing documents.
3.  **Push to Repository:** Commit all documentation to a dedicated directory (e.g., `docs/vX.X.X/`).
4.  **Confirm Readiness:** Announce that the specifications are complete and ready for commissioning.

## IV. Best Practices

-   **No Backend Changes is the Goal:** The primary goal of this process is to build a frontend that works with the *existing* backend. Only propose backend changes as a last resort.
-   **The Backend is the Source of Truth:** If there is a discrepancy between the frontend design and the backend API, the backend API is correct. The frontend design must adapt.
-   **Over-Document the Integration:** It is better to provide too much detail on how the frontend and backend should connect than too little.
-   **Use this Skill Before Writing Code:** This process should be completed *before* any significant frontend development begins.

## V. Quality Checklist

Before commissioning the work, ensure you can answer "yes" to all of the following questions:

-   [ ] Have you read the main entrypoint of the backend application?
-   [ ] Have you read the handlers for all relevant API endpoints?
-   [ ] Have you written a comprehensive feature specification that includes API contracts?
-   [ ] Have you created a backend integration guide with code examples?
-   [ ] Have all development prompts been updated with a "Backend Grounding" section?
-   [ ] Have you audited all documentation for completeness and pushed it to the repository?

## OpenClaw Tool Integration

When running inside the Dojo Genesis plugin:

1. **Start** by calling `dojo_get_context` to retrieve full project state, history, and artifacts
2. **During** the skill, follow the workflow steps documented above
3. **Save** outputs using `dojo_save_artifact` with the `artifacts` output directory
4. **Update** project state by calling `dojo_update_state` to record skill completion and any phase transitions
